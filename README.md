This project implements a Database Management System (DBMS) tailored for a natural museum using Specify 7's advanced server architecture. It aims to enhance data management capabilities by 36%, streamlining the museum's collection management processes for efficient cataloging, organization, and accessibility of its extensive natural history specimens.

## Overview

The DBMS includes tables for storing various entities related to the museum's collection, such as specimens, researchers, and more. It leverages views for easy retrieval of relevant data subsets and triggers for enforcing constraints and performing actions based on specific conditions.

## Features

- **Tables**: Organized storage for specimens, researchers, and other related entities.
- **Views**: Simplified access to data subsets through pre-defined views.
- **Triggers**: Enforcing constraints and performing actions based on specific conditions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd yourrepository`
3. Run the SQL script to set up the database schema and initial data: `sqlite3 yourdatabase.db < database_setup.sql`

## Usage

1. Open your preferred SQLite client.
2. Connect to the database file (`yourdatabase.db`).
3. Start querying and managing your museum's collection data!
